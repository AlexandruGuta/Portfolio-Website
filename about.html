            <p id="p_about">Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website.<br><br> My names is Marian Alexandru Guta. I am from Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Now, I am living in Copenhagen, Denmark, as I am currently studying Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA. During this semester, I have been taking part in loads of projects being surrounded by some of my classmates. Thankfully, I have aquired a bunch of new skills and qualities such as collaboration and team working. What's more, this edcuational programme made me realise how much effort is behind every webpage. My critical spirit poped by and helped me in taking any decision regarding the design of everything that I have been doing lately, including this portfolio website. <br><br>All in all, I am aware of the fact that, I am on the very beginning of becoming a Web Developer, but at the same time, I feel ready to widen my knowledge.</p>
